AID: Assist ImproveD
=====================

"AID: Assist ImproveD" (or just AID) is an ambitious attempt at improving the functionality of [ASSIST](http://www.assist.org/). From its site, "ASSIST is an online student-transfer information system that shows how course credits earned at one public California college or university can be applied when transferred to another. ASSIST is the official repository of articulation for Californiaâ€™s public colleges and universities and provides the most accurate and up-to-date information about student transfer in California." Note that AID is not affiliated with ASSIST in any way.

While AID started out as a project with goals only to make a website with a prettier/easier-to-use interface (as opposed to ASSIST's current interface), plans have since been proposed to add more useful functionality that ASSIST currently does not provide. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide a better experience for students, counselors, and anyone who uses ASSIST.

One of the biggest obstacles to this project was (and will continue to be) the collection of ASSIST's data for the project's own use. Unfortunately, ASSIST does not provide an API to their data and, on top of that, individual articulations are not always uniform in structure.

This project's answer to that is [AssistScrape](https://github.com/DevelopersGuild/Assistscrape), a separate project being used as a component to fill AID's database.

## [AndroidAssist](https://github.com/DevelopersGuild/AndroidAssist)

With goals to bring a similar experience to the mobile app platform, [AndroidAssist](https://github.com/DevelopersGuild/AndroidAssist) is a project also being developed alongside AID. Where AID is a web app that targets PC users, AndroidAssist aims to bring the same functionality to Android mobile devices.
